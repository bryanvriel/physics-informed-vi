# README

This lightweight version of `pgan` consists only of a collection of convenience classes and routines for creating and training neural networks using TensorFlow 2. It allows for creation of lower-level neural network models, as well as models consisting of multiple sub-models, to simplify creation, modification, saving, and loading of trainable variables. `pgan` also includes some containers for multi-dimensional variables and convenience functions for logging training results to TensorBoard.
